# Overview
The notebooks are part of the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree where an implementation of graph-SLAM had to be made inside a 2D world.

# Description
- SLAM gives us a way to both localize a robot and build up a map of its environment as a robot moves and senses in real-time.

- In this implementation, SLAM is used to localize a robot in a self-made 2D world.

# Files
* **Robot Moving and Sensing.ipynb**: Where the robot class is made
* **Omega and Xi, Constraints.ipynb**: Explanation on how SLAM matrix operation are made.
* **Landmark Detection and Tracking**: Notebook containing code for implementation of graph-SLAM in a 2D world.

# Conclusions
- At the end of the project the SLAM implementations was compared to some test poses and landmarks to check if our model matched the test, and after throwing the results, this were almost identical to the test.
